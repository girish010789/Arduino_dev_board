This post is about how to program arduino with python

   Most of the microcontrollers/hardware/development board will have an onboard interpretation language, something which the SDK's/IDE are based on.
   Ardunio IDE's are mostly C/C++/Java based and is used as a platform for software development to write and upload programs onto arduino board.
   
   But if you are someone who is familiar with any other language, mostly python (since we live in a ML/NN era and python is usually the defacto language these days), we have options to write python codes and run it on dev board
   Note that this can be done with any arduino board using the interface protocol named PYFIRMATA. 
    
   Firmata library is a firmata protocol for communication between microcontroller and host computer. This allows you to write custom software without creating our own protocol. To use this protocol with python, we use pyfirmata.

   Before using this, we need to add pyfirmata module to python using
      pip install pyfirmata

   Now plug the Arduino Uno using the USB-A port to your host computer. Open any text editor, visual studio or xcode and start writing the python code
  
   Here is a common example of LED blink using python on Arduino. 
  
  ##Importing the libaries before using
  import pyfirmata
  from pyfirmata import Arduino, util
  import time

   ##Specify the connectivity of Arduino Uno with your computer. 
  board = Arduino("/dev/tty.usb*")
  
  ##Specify the number of times LED needs to blink
  loopTimes = input('How many times would you like the LED to blink: ')
  print("Blinking " + loopTimes + " times.")

  for x in range(int(loopTimes)):
        board.digital[13].write(1)
        time.sleep(0.2)
        board.digital[13].write(0)
        time.sleep(0.2)
